Code Description (EXER 08)::

Contains a folder named "components" that contains js and css files for web programming which practices React JS. 

App.js contains the main component and imports other parts like ItemsPanel and NaviPanel onto it. Also contains the list of items that is called onto the other components.

NaviPanel.js is responsible for the header. I initially though I have to actually use the options in the navigation panels so I kind of got carried away with it, though I spent the most time exploring react JS on the navi Panel.

ItemsPanel.js contains the items. It also uses react JS. I didn't really create a pushcarts array for the exer 08 part... but I added the console log for the add to cart button.

App.css contains the css flex designs used on the three files.
