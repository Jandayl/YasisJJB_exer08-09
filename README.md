Code Description (EXER 08)::

Contains a folder named "components" that contains js and css files for web programming which practices React JS. 

App.js contains the main component and imports other parts like ItemsPanel and NaviPanel onto it. Also contains the list of items that is called onto the other components.

NaviPanel.js is responsible for the header. I initially though I have to actually use the options in the navigation panels so I kind of got carried away with it, though I spent the most time exploring react JS on the navi Panel.

ItemsPanel.js contains the items. It also uses react JS. I didn't really create a pushcarts array for the exer 08 part... but I added the console log for the add to cart button.

App.css contains the css flex designs used on the three files.


Code Description (Exer 09) ::

Same components, there's only one added component which is the shopping cart.
The shopping cart records the items added to cart (by clicking the add to cart button of the item) as well as the amount of times the button is clicked (or the item's quantity). It also contains a delete button which removes the item and all its quantity from the shopping cart. It can be seen on the right side of the body of the webpage along with the items using flexbox (it's in the same flexbox as the items).
